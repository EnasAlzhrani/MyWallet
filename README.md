# MyWallet

# Introduction

We live in a consumerism culture, where people want to buy things, they don'tneed, which can lead to them losing money easily by focusing too much on buying useless things instead of things they need. That's where the concept
of organizing finances comes, which is when someone keeps track of where
and when his/her money goes.

In recent years, people have realized the benefits of organizing their spending
and its importance, like how it can help you in saving money for your plans
and helps you to focus on what's important.

The lack of efficient spending management can help to drive people into debt
and can harm their finances as much as not having enough money, and that's
why people need to consider organizing their spending more seriously.

# Statement of Problem

Many people want to start organizing their finances, but some reasons may
prevent them from doing so, a person may want to start organizing his/her
spending but not have the time to do so, or don't even know where to start.

Nowadays it becomes even harder for someone to organize his/her finances
due to the many paying options and the often loose of bills.
Therefore, we thought about a solution for the mentioned problems, we call it 'MyWallet'.

MyWallet is a phone application that is designed to help users in organizing
their finances and income. It provides the user with the ability to categorize
his/her spending to help him/her to know how where his/her money goes.

We work on providing help to those who don't have an idea on where to start
saving by 'MyWallet' application that will contain the features they need.
